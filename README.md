# Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio contains a summary of my work, including machine learning exercises, a hackathon project, and critical reflections.

This website is built automatically using GitHub Pages. The main page you're reading right now is generated from the `README.md` file.

## Table of Contents

1.  **[Hyperparameter gridsearch](./1-hypertuning-gridsearch/summary.md)**
    * I found the assignment very educational, especially training a feed-forward neural network. Trying out the Adam optimizer, CrossEntropyLoss, and a ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler was also interesting. I quickly discovered that larger networks achieved higher accuracy compared to smaller ones. However, with larger networks you have to be careful to avoid overfitting.
1.  **[Hyperparameter mlflow](./2-hypertuning-mlflow/summary.md)**
    * I studied the material but due to family circumstances i have not be able to try it out.
1.  **[Hyperparameter rnn](./3-hypertuning-rnn/summary.md)**
    * Summary of the third week
1.  **[Hyperparameter ray](./4-hypertuning-ray/summary.md)**
    * A summary of my findings from tuning a Random Forest Classifier.
1.  **[Hackathon Model: Project Cuddlefish](./6-hackathon/project_cuddlefish.md)**
    * Our award-winning model that predicts the optimal camouflage pattern for a cuttlefish based on its environment.
1.  **[deployment](./5-deployment/summary.md)**
    * The result of my own deployment
1.  **[Ethical Reflection: The Cuddlefish Dilemma](./7-ethics/summary.md)**
    * A critical analysis of the ethical implications of AI-driven camouflage.


## How to setup your own portfolio
- fork this repo
- go to the **settings** tab on top of your github page
- first, enable issues by scrolling down, and under "features" check the "issues" checkbox. 
- Then, on the left-hand menu click on the **Pages** tab
- under build and deployment, select `deploy from a branch`
- select main/root and save

After a few minutes you will see the site is published.
